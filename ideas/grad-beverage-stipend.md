# Grad Student Weekly Beverage Stipend
  - All grad students in the computer science department should be given a daily/weekly/monthly stipend towards the cost of beverages consumed while conducting academic business
  - Examples:
    - Coffee while working on research (either in a lab or at an on-campus location)
    - Beer when collaborating with fellow students about research
  - Cost to department: TBD
  - Benefits to department: TBD
  - Implementation:
    - Students submit receipts to to supervisors who claim the funds on behalf of their students. The supervisor will decide which purchases are acceptable.


Alternatively, decent coffee should be available to grad students on normal business days. It must be convenient such that it does not impact the work of the grad students.

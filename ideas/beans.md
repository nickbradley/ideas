# Platform for collecting and managing user data

## Motivation



## Possible Research Questions
  - What data should be considered personally identifiable given the granularity of the data? Is there a way to split the data among subscribers so that none of them could individually identify a user?
  - What prevents people from just scraping the public data and then registering an authorized app to get the
  - How keep keep data secure after it has been served?


## Key Points
  - Centralize (from an API perspective) data collection and access
  - "Data apps" that can run on top of the user data to give it utility
  - Anonymized data can be used without user consent
  - Authorized API access when linking data to user (token will act as ephemeral ID to user details)
  - Applications of data migration (hot -> warm -> cold) and data summarization
  - Incentive for
    - advertisers: consistent API, more data (including click through on competitors ads)
    - companies: smarter applications
    - users: data authorization
    - researchers: data!
